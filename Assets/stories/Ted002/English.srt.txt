00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,089
In the years before World War Two,

2
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:13,259
a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,720
in the German town of Herzogenaurach.

4
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:19,974
But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument—

5
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:24,395
a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two.

6
00:00:25,188 --> 00:00:29,484
At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel.

7
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:31,402
But over the coming years,

8
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:34,781
this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach.

9
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:39,619
Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe.

10
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:44,957
Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged.

11
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:50,296
Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks”

12
00:00:50,296 --> 00:00:53,633
because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting

13
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,593
with members of their group.

14
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:59,889
But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes?

15
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,184
Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences

16
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:05,269
to produce this degree of conflict?

17
00:01:05,603 --> 00:01:10,650
To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,112
and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol.

19
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:18,116
This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm,

20
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:20,451
a methodology designed to investigate

21
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:24,288
the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other.

22
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,543
Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors

23
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:30,002
that lead to hostility,

24
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:34,132
such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences.

25
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,509
Then, they would split into groups,

26
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,721
and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time

27
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:42,849
to see what stirred up conflict.

28
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:46,102
But first, they needed
a control condition—

29
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:49,313
a pair of groups without any group bias.

30
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,483
The researchers told participants
they were being grouped

31
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:56,237
based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly;

32
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:59,115
but in reality, 
the groups were totally random.

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,161
Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted,

34
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:06,622
no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds.

35
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:09,834
Then everyone was given resources
to distribute.

36
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:14,630
Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group,

37
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,466
and importantly, everything was anonymous.

38
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:20,136
So whatever a participant decided,

39
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:24,765
it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive.

40
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:28,519
With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed

41
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:31,647
and no reason for competition
over resources,

42
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:35,943
the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline

43
00:02:35,943 --> 00:02:37,320
for further research.

44
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:39,488
But even in these groups,

45
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:43,242
where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity

46
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:45,786
in possessing an arbitrary skill,

47
00:02:45,786 --> 00:02:49,290
individuals still showed in-group bias.

48
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:54,462
They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group.

49
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:57,340
Later, research went even further,

50
00:02:57,423 --> 00:03:02,261
informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership

51
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:03,679
was a coin flip.

52
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:06,682
But group bias still occurred.

53
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:10,853
The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough.

54
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:16,734
So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences,

55
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,069
what was left?

56
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:22,198
What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences

57
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:25,451
for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups?

58
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:30,539
The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity.

59
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:36,337
People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity.

60
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:41,467
And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized

61
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:46,847
as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self.

62
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:50,559
Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity,

63
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:55,398
participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group—

64
00:03:55,648 --> 00:04:00,611
pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves

65
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:01,988
as individuals.

66
00:04:02,488 --> 00:04:06,492
Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe,

67
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:10,997
examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention,

68
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:14,292
perception, memory, and emotions.

69
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:18,379
The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions

70
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:23,009
appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities.

71
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:27,888
So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden

72
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:30,433
into much more serious divides.

73
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:34,770
That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart.

74
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:37,565
Bringing individuals together 
in a new group

75
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:41,819
can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases.

76
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:47,116
However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors

77
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:49,744
that reinforce existing group identities.

78
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:54,290
Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition,

79
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,794
and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that.

80
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,673
So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves

81
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:05,259
as inclusive of others as possible.
